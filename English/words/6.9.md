The vegetation in the Himalayas varies tremendously from one part of the Himalayas to another.
The Eastern Himalayas are characterised by tropical rainforests. 
Subtropical and alpine forests are indicative of the Central and Western Himalayas.
The Transhimalaya is considered a desert region. 
The conditions caused by the altitude and climate have a tremendous effect on the Himalayas' vegetation. 
The low to medium altitudes contain climates ranging from tropical deciduous forests in the foothills to balmy forests in the medium altitudes. 
As the altitude increases, coniferous and alpine forests can be found.
The even higher altitudes contain alpine grasslands and meadows, right up to the permanent snowline. 
Over time, the Himalayas have drastically changed, especially with respect to their flora and fauna. 
The root cause of this change has been man. Many centuries ago, the forests were able to replenish themselves as the demand for the resources was smaller and manageable. 
Man has gradually become more dependent on the forests to satisfy his needs, which has thrown off the natural balance. 
The problems have continued with the increase in human population and the demands on the forests from various industries. 
The forests are being destroyed both for firewood and to support manufacturing. 
Forests are cleared to provide additional space for the increasing population. 
Trees that existed in abundance in the Himalayas five decades ago are now rare or nonexistent. 
According to the text above, where are the deserts of the Himalayas located?

喜马拉雅山的植被在喜马拉雅山的不同地区差异很大。喜马拉雅东部的特点是热带雨林。亚热带和高山森林是喜马拉雅中西部的标志。Transhimalaya 被认为是沙漠地区。海拔和气候造成的条件对喜马拉雅山的植被有着巨大的影响。中低海拔地区的气候从山麓的热带落叶林到中等海拔地区的温和森林不等。随着海拔的升高，可以发现针叶林和高山林。更高的海拔包括高山草原和草甸，直到永久的雪线。随着时间的推移，喜马拉雅山脉发生了巨大的变化，特别是在动植物方面。这种变化的根本原因是人类。许多世纪以前，森林能够自我补充，因为对资源的需求较小且可控。人类逐渐变得更加依赖森林来满足自己的需求，这打破了自然的平衡。随着人口的增加和各种工业对森林的需求，这些问题继续存在。这些森林不仅被用来烧柴，还被用来支持制造业。森林被砍伐，为不断增加的人口提供更多的空间。五十年前在喜马拉雅地区盛产的树木现在已经很稀少或者根本不存在了。根据上面的文字，喜马拉雅山脉的沙漠位于哪里？

Melissa has spent the last four years studying sculpture in art college. 
She has learned several different methods such as casting, welding, and freeform construction. 
She enjoys clay and plasticine modelling, but her preference is for the traditional centuries-old carving techniques that are used on blocks of stone and wood. using hammer and chisel, she painstakingly chipped and carved away the excess material to reveal the form within. 
Which phrase in the above paragraph is grammatically INCORRECT?

梅丽莎在过去的四年里一直在艺术学院学习雕塑。她已经学会了几种不同的方法，如铸造，焊接，和自由的建设。她喜欢粘土和橡皮泥模型，但她的偏好是传统的几个世纪以来的雕刻技术，用于石块和木材。她用锤子和凿子精心地凿去多余的材料，显露出里面的形状。以上段落中的哪个短语在语法上是不正确的？

magma 岩浆

ring vaccination 环形疫苗

## Water powered the Tonga eruption
Researchers are starting to piece together why the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption on 15 January was so explosive. Evidence gathered by two groups suggests that when the Tongan volcano’s centre collapsed, it spewed an enormous amount of magma that reacted violently with water. “You’ve got 20-degree water and you’ve got 1,110-degree magma coming directly in contact,” says volcanologist Shane Cronin, who co-authored one study about the event. The caldera was just shallow enough that the water pressure did not suppress the blast, but deep enough that the magma was fed huge amounts of water to power the interactions. This resulted in several large blasts and hundreds of much smaller explosions every minute, which eyewitnesses reported hearing as an unusual “crackling and noise like artillery fire”.

研究人员开始拼凑为什么1月15日的 Hunga Tong-Hunga Ha apai 火山爆发如此具有爆炸性。两个研究小组收集的证据表明，当汤加火山中心坍塌时，喷出大量岩浆，岩浆与水发生剧烈反应。“你有20度的水，你有1110度的岩浆直接接触，说:”火山学家谢恩克罗宁，谁共同撰写了一项关于该事件的研究。火山口很浅，水压不足以抑制爆炸，但足够深，岩浆被注入大量的水来推动相互作用。这导致了几次大爆炸和每分钟数百次小得多的爆炸，目击者称听到的是不寻常的“噼啪声和炮火般的噪音”

## Monkeypox vaccination begins
Countries including Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States have begun implementing a strategy called ‘ring vaccination’ to try to halt the spread of monkeypox. This involves administering smallpox vaccines — which are thought to be about 85% effective against monkeypox because the viruses are related — to people who have been exposed to monkeypox through close contact with an infected person. There are downsides to the approach: it requires rigorous contact tracing, and the vaccines have had limited testing against monkeypox. It also raises eyebrows among researchers in Africa who have been fighting monkeypox outbreaks for decades without a vaccine stockpile.

包括加拿大、英国和美国在内的一些国家已经开始实施一项名为“环形疫苗接种”的战略，试图阻止猴痘的传播。这包括对那些通过与感染者密切接触而接触到猴痘的人使用天花疫苗。由于这些病毒与猴痘有关，因此天花疫苗被认为对猴痘有效率约为85% 。这种方法也有缺点: 它需要严格的接触追踪，而且疫苗对猴痘的测试有限。这也引起了非洲研究人员的惊讶，他们在没有疫苗储备的情况下与猴痘爆发进行了几十年的斗争。

## It was two trees all along
A genetic study confirms that a popular fruit tree given the scientific name Artocarpus odoratissimus has been two separate species all along. The evidence supports the knowledge of some of the people who know the plants best: the Iban and Dusun people on the island of Borneo, where the tree was probably domesticated. Iban people call A. odoratissimus trees with large fruit and leaves lumok, and dub trees with smaller, less sweet fruit pingan. Now lumok retains the name A. odoratissimus and pingan has been given the scientific name Artocarpus mutabilis.

一项基因研究证实，一种名为Artocarpus odoratissimus的流行果树一直是两个独立的物种。证据支持一些最了解植物的人的知识：婆罗洲岛上的伊班人和杜顺人，那里的树可能被驯化了。伊班人称A. odoratissimus树为大果实和叶子lumok，并将树木与较小，较不甜的果实称为pingan。现在，lumok保留了A. odoratissimus这个名字，而pingan被赋予了学名Artocarpus mutabilis。


## How coffee might change your brain
Research in mice suggests that caffeine creates long-lasting changes in the brain. Animals who drank caffeine-infused water for two weeks had changes in gene-activity patterns in many types of brain cell, leading to an overall decrease in the synthesis of proteins involved in metabolism and an increase in those involved in neuronal signalling and plasticity. After a learning task, the caffeinated mice exhibited a larger boost in the activity of genes involved in processes such as memory formation than did mice that hadn’t consumed caffeine.

对老鼠的研究表明，咖啡因会对大脑产生持久的影响。饮用含咖啡因水两周的动物在许多类型的脑细胞中的基因活动模式发生了变化，导致参与新陈代谢的蛋白质合成总体减少，参与神经元信号传导和可塑性的蛋白质合成增加。在完成一项学习任务后，含咖啡因的老鼠比没有摄入咖啡因的老鼠表现出更大的基因活动增强，这些基因参与了记忆形成等过程。

### Pompeii coins hint at finances of the dead
Ancient coins found with skeletons in Pompeii hint at the economic status of those who did not flee before Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD 79. Of about 200 victims carrying coins, roughly half carried small sums in low-value currency — suggesting that the richest had already made themselves scarce. Or maybe Pompeiians were just not that into coins.

古代硬币与骨骼发现庞贝暗示了那些谁没有逃离之前，维苏威火山爆发在公元79年的经济地位。在大约200名携带硬币的受害者中，大约一半人携带小额低价货币，这表明最富有的人已经逃之夭夭。也许庞贝人不太喜欢硬币。

### How beavers foster biodiversity
Research in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany’s oldest national park and part of the largest unbroken protected forest in Central Europe, reveals beavers’ outstanding ability to foster biodiversity. Ponds built by the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) boasted 196 species that lived in no other habitat in the park, including 76 species under threat. 

巴伐利亚森林国家公园是德国最古老的国家公园，也是中欧最大的未被破坏的保护森林的一部分。由欧亚海狸(蓖麻纤维)建造的池塘拥有196个物种，它们生活在公园里没有其他栖息地的地方，包括76个濒临灭绝的物种

## Science must overcome its racist legacy
In the first Nature editorial ever to be signed by guest editors, four authors explore the history of racist beliefs in science. Political scientist Melissa Nobles, epidemiologist and science-inclusion leader Chad Womack, geneticist Ambroise Wonkam and environmentalist Elizabeth Wathuti will advise on the production of a series of special issues on racism in science, the first of which is due to be published later this year. 

“The journey to recognizing and removing racism will take time, because meaningful change does not happen quickly," they write. "It will be difficult, because it will require powerful institutions to accept that they need to be accountable to those with less power. It will be rewarding because it will enrich science. It is essential because it is about truth, justice and reconciliation — tenets on which all societies must be founded. As scientists, we know that where there are problems in the historical record, scientific rigour and scientific integrity demand that they be acknowledged, and, if necessary, corrected.”

在《自然》杂志有史以来第一篇由客座编辑签名的社论中，四位作者探讨了科学领域种族主义信仰的历史。政治学家梅丽莎 · 诺布尔斯、流行病学家和科学纳入领导人查德 · 沃马克、遗传学家安布罗斯 · 旺卡姆和环保人士伊丽莎白 · 瓦图提将为制作一系列关于科学中种族主义的特刊提供建议，第一期将于今年晚些时候出版。

他们写道: “承认和消除种族主义的过程需要时间，因为有意义的改变不会很快发生。”。“这将很困难，因为这需要强大的机构接受这样一个事实: 它们需要对那些权力较小的机构负责。这将是有益的，因为它将丰富科学。它之所以必不可少，是因为它事关真理、正义与和解ーー所有社会都必须建立在这些原则之上。作为科学家，我们知道，在历史记录中存在问题的地方，科学的严谨性和科学的完整性要求我们承认这些问题，并在必要时予以纠正。”
